### Initialize Terraform:

Navigate to the terraform directory within your project and run:
```
terraform --version
terraform init
```

This initializes Terraform and downloads the required plugins.

### Configure Remote State Backend:

Create a Cloud Storage bucket to store the Terraform state:
```
gsutil mb gs://your-bucket-name
```

### Configure Terraform to use the bucket as the backend:

```
backend "remote" {
  hostname = "storage.googleapis.com"
  bucket = "your-bucket-name"
  key    = "terraform.tfstate"
}
```
Replace "your-bucket-name" with your actual bucket name, universally unique identifiable.

### Run Terraform plan and apply:

Run terraform plan to preview the infrastructure changes.

```
terraform apply
```

Review the plan and if satisfied, run terraform apply to create the resources in GCP.

### Simulate State Refresh:

Manually create a new firewall rule in the GCP Console allowing SSH access (port 22) to your instance.
Run terraform refresh to update the Terraform state with the latest resources in GCP.

Additional Notes:

You can install a basic web server software (e.g., Apache or Nginx) on the instance using user data or a startup script defined in the google_compute_instance resource.
Remember to update the variable values in variables.tf with your any specific project details.
